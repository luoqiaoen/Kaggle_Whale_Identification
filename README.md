Siamese twin approach detailed for previous challenge:

It was refactored and customized to be used for a new dataset, model is trained on my own Linux machine.

Siamese twin neural network is a supervised metric learning architecture, once trained, it can be used to do one-shot classification on test image. Paper: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf
